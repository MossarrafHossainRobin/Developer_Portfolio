            <p>I think fearless is having fears but jumping anyway. Living at risk is jumping off the cliff and building
                your wings on the way down. The key to growth is acknowledging your fear of the unknown and jumping in
                anyway.</p>

                <p>I think we all should start thinking about what we should do, so taking these two instances I want
                    you to
                    ask yourself why you want to become a software developer. Because it is a long stream, and becoming
                    a
                    software developer is all about coding, but coding is not all about just coding, its about solving
                    the
                    problems.</p>
